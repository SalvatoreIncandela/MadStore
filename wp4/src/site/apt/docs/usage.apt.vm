Using MadStore

* Installing MadStore

    Once you've got the MadStore binaries, by {{{/download.html}downloading}} or {{{/docs/build.html}building}} them,
    you're ready to install your distribution of choice.

    Unarchive the <<standalone>> distribution if you want to run MadStore within its embedded container; here is its directory structure:

        * <conf> : contains the <madstoreConfguration.xml> file to edit for configuring MadStore.

        * <standalone> : contains the MadStore standalone jar files for the main and grid node applications.

        * <gridgain> : contains the {{{http://www.gridgain.com}GridGain}} distribution, needed for running MadStore crawler in grid mode.

        * <sources> : contains all MadStore sources.

    Unarchive the <<war>> distribution if you want to run MadStore within your Servlet 2.4 container of choice; here is its directory structure:

        * <conf> : contains the <madstoreConfguration.xml> file to edit for configuring MadStore.

        * <war> : contains the MadStore standalone war files for the main and grid node applications.

        * <gridgain> : contains the {{{http://www.gridgain.com}GridGain}} distribution, needed for running MadStore crawler in grid mode.

        * <sources> : contains all MadStore sources.

    Then set the <MADSTORE_HOME> environment variable to point to the MadStore distribution directory: <<don't miss this step>>.

    Now you're ready to {{{/docs/configuration.html}configure}} MadStore and deploy it!

* Deploying MadStore as a standalone application.

    MadStore can be deployed as a standalone web application by simply unarchiving the standalone distribution and running the following command:

---
java -jar $MADSTORE_HOME/standalone/madstore-app-VERSION-standalone.jar
---

    Then, you can access it by pointing your browser at: <http://your-host:8080/>.

    It works by using {{{http://winstone.sourceforge.net/}Winstone}} as an embedded servlet container, so you may pass
    all Winstone {{{http://winstone.sourceforge.net/#commandLine}command-line}} options.

    If you configured MadStore to run with the crawler in grid mode, you can run as much MadStore grid nodes as you want by
    executing the following command:

---
java -jar $MADSTORE_HOME/standalone/madstore-gridnode-VERSION-standalone.jar
---

    Again, it works by using {{{http://winstone.sourceforge.net/}Winstone}} as an embedded servlet container, so you may pass
    all Winstone {{{http://winstone.sourceforge.net/#commandLine}command-line}} options.

* Deploying MadStore into a Servlet container.

    MadStore war file provided with the war distribution, can be deployed into any Servlet 2.4 container, such as {{{http://tomcat.apache.org}Apache Tomcat}}:
    just deploy the <madstore-app-VERSION.war> file.

    The same applies for the MadStore grid node: just deploy the <madstore-gridnode-VERSION.war> file.

* Accessing MadStore

    Atom contents published by MadStore can be accessed as specified by the following URL templates:

        * <<http://host:port/service>>\
        The Atom Publishing Protocol service document, describing published collections.

        []

        * <<http://host:port/\{collection\}>>\
        An Atom Publishing Protocol collection, identified by the <collection> key.

            * <<http://host:port/\{collection\}?max=\{max\}&page=\{page\}>>\
            An Atom Publishing Protocol collection, identified by the <collection> key, with a
            <max> number of entries starting at the given <page>. The returned collection feed supports
            {{{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005} feed paging}} in order to navigate through collection entries.

        []

        * <<http://host:port/\{collection\}/\{entry\}>>\
        An Atom entry, identified by the <entry> key and belonging to the given <collection>.

        []

        * <<http://host:port/search>>\
        The Open Search description document, describing exposed open search URLs.

        []

        * <<http://host:port/search/\{collection\}?title=\{title\}&terms=\{terms\}&max=\{max\}&page=\{page\}>>\
        Search the given <collection>, returning an Atom feed with the given <title>, containing
        a <max> number of entries starting at the given <page> and containing the given <terms>
        in the configured indexed properties. The returned feed supports
        {{{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005} feed paging}} in order to navigate through collection entries.
