    JGroups localhost configuration.
    This file provides TCP based GridJgroupsDiscoverySpi and GridJgroupsCommunicationSpi
    for node discovery and message exchange.

    Note that some versions of JGroups may require
    an explicit bind address to be specified for IPv6.

    Refer to http://www.jgroups.org or http://www.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JGroups
    for more information about JGroups configuration.

    If you have an OS with IPv6 enabled, Java applications may try to route IP multicast
    traffic over IPv6. Use "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true" system property at VM startup
    to prevent this.
